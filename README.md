# lean-perfectoid-spaces
A formalization of the concept of a perfectoid space in the Lean formal theorem prover.

### Definition of a perfectoid space in the Lean Programming Language.

This is a project whose first goal is to create a "type" in a certain computer language. The language is Lean, which is some variant of dependent type theory. The name of the type is `perfectoid_space`. A *perfectoid space* is a term of this type. Hence any computer program which outputs a term of this type could be said to be a program which computed a perfectoid space.
